# Gait-it

This repository contains codebase of our project :- Human Identification Using Deep Gait Recognition

Human gait or a distinct walking pattern is a biometric pattern which allows identification of an individual when other biometric features like face or iris is not visible. With the existing state-of-the-art models, we canâ€™t handle inter-distinctive inter-class differences of human gait in real-time. In this paper, we have proposed a novel approach called GaitNet which directly learns a mapping from the pose extracted images to compact gait embeddings in the semantic space where distances directly correspond to a measure of gait similarity. On top of it, we have developed a Siamese based neural network gait recognition pipeline to extract robust and discriminative gait features for human identification. Our experiments on the gait recognition framework demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.
